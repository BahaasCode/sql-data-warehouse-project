**# Medallion Arch Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse project**! 
This project was built following a tutorial by **DataWithBaraa** (https://www.youtube.com/@DataWithBaraa) and expanded with my own modifications
The data warehouse is designed to follow a simple **medallion architecture** and use **ETL** processes to help build and expand an understanding on Data Engineering. The project demonstrates a comprehension to data warehousing, from building the blueprints to a warehouse to making actionable insights. Created as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in Data Engineering and Analytics while showcasing hands-on technical ability and problem solving.
